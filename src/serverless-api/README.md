# Todo Serverless API

The serverless API runs on top of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) behind a [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) [HTTP API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html). 

It implements the TODO API using DynamoDB for todo storage.
