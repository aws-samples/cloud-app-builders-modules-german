# Todo Container-based API

The container-based API is based on a Python3 [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) application running inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. In this example application it is deployed to [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).

It implements the TODO API using [Amazon RDS MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/) for todo storage.
